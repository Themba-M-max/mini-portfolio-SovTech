.# A mini portfolio for SovTech :+1:
A mini web application displaying my interest towards applying to SovTech 

# Getting started
The following are instructions on how to run the application

## Prerequisites
You will need Node.js which comes with NPM installed on your computer
```
@node@v16.4.2 or higher
npm@7.18.1 or higher
```

# How to use 
Download the package from Craig's github then, After that install NPM dependencies. You also need to install Next, React and React-Dom NPM Packages
```
># Install dependencies
$ npm install

># Download Next, React, and React-Dom NPM Packages
$ npm install --save next react react-dom

```
Once the server has started, run the application by using `npm run dev` then go to the URL `localhost:3000` to run the application. 
Now the SovTech personal portfolio has been bootstrapped :+1:
