        <p>
           I am recently finished my degree in Computer Science at the University of Cape Town.
           I would love to work at SovTech because I believe it would provide a great foundation to the start of my career as a Software Engineer.
           I would love to gain as much experience as possible and I believe that I would be very valuable to the company because as I am very hungry to produce software of industry standard.
